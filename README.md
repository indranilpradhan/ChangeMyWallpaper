# ChangeMyWallpaper

Write a python script to change the wallpaper of your laptop on the basis of current weather and
time. Make sure to handle all the error conditions properly. One possible way is to keep 3-4
wallpers for each season and time in a folder and select one of them by using the weather/time
values.
